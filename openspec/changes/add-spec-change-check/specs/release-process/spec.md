## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Specification change authorization on dev
Pull requests into dev SHALL pass the required spec-change check. One shared checker SHALL enforce intake Spec scope and accept authorization only from Dan's comments, using the dedicated read-only task credential. Other tests SHALL remain local for dev.

#### Scenario: Existing specification is changed without authorization
- **WHEN** an intake-ready comment declares Spec scope and a pull request removes or changes existing specification lines without a matching spec-change entry from Dan
- **THEN** the check fails and lists the uncovered requirements

#### Scenario: Additions and the task's own change
- **WHEN** a pull request only adds requirements or edits its own change declared by intake
- **THEN** the check passes without an authorization block
- **AND** deltas that modify existing requirements still require authorization

#### Scenario: Authorized changes
- **WHEN** every affected existing requirement and foreign change has a matching operation in Dan's spec-change block for this component
- **THEN** the check passes

#### Scenario: Bot impersonates authorization
- **WHEN** an authorization block is posted by a bot instead of Dan
- **THEN** the block does not authorize any changes

#### Scenario: Task predates scope declarations
- **WHEN** the task's intake-ready comments contain no Spec scope line
- **THEN** the check passes as a legacy task

#### Scenario: Foreign change edited or archived
- **WHEN** a pull request edits or archives another task's change
- **THEN** the matching edit or archive entry from Dan is required

#### Scenario: Task data is unavailable
- **WHEN** the task cannot be identified or its comments cannot be read completely
- **THEN** the check fails with an actionable error

#### Scenario: Local merge automation
- **WHEN** local merge automation invokes the checker with a repository, base, head, component, and task branch
- **THEN** the same authorization rules and exit status apply as in CI

#### Scenario: Candidate code cannot replace the checker
- **WHEN** a pull request changes checker scripts or workflow definitions
- **THEN** the trusted workflow reads candidate Git objects without checking out or executing candidate files
- **AND** the shared checker content is verified against a digest fixed in the trusted workflow before execution
- **AND** only the checker process receives the read-only task credential

#### Scenario: Malformed scope declaration
- **WHEN** the latest intake-ready Spec scope line is empty or does not identify an own change
- **THEN** the check fails with an error instead of accepting the task as legacy
